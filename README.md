# Keras-Workshop
Keras Workshop for Tucson Python Meetup.
The focus of this workshop is to get you acquainted with Keras, so all of the Matplotlib (sorry, __[@hclent](https://github.com/hclent)__) and numpy/scipy stuff is taken care of for you.

# How to do dis
 - Read the first project, complete each of the tasks. Once you finish, you'll have implemented your own feed-forward neural network for binary classification. (yay!)
 - Once you've played with the first project to your heart's content, try the second project
 - The projects were written in Jupyter. If you don't have Jupyter, you can edit the *.py files, it's just not as much fun
 - The Jupyter notebooks have links to relevant information (Keras documentation, Wiki pages, memes, etc.)
